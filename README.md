# JavaScript / TypeScript / jQuery Demos

This public repository is nothing more that a storage queue of concepts and tricks I've learned over the past several years. As I learned something new, or **relearned** something I once knew and had forgotten is more likely, I would whip up a little demo page within this site so I could refer back to it whenever needed. The practice and the archiving of these tasks has been very beneficial. 

Use as you wish and at your own risk.  I make no guarantees regarding the quality of this code - it is simply for my own personal reference. Perhaps you will find it useful too.

It you find any obvious errors, feel free to let me know:   [shane.fowlkes.70@gmail.com](mailto:shane.fowlkes.70@gmail.com "shane.fowlkes.70@gmail.com").
