// IManager is an extension of IEmployee.
// There is a difference between 'inherits' and 'extends'.
//
// Extends is like a derived class to a base abstract class.
// With Abstracts using 'extends', you do not need to redefine all properties and methods.
// They are automatically inherited into the derived class.
//
// With 'implements', you DO need to define everything in the class which is inhertiting
// the interface.  It is a contract.  Your class MUST look like what you are 'â€‹inheriting'.
//
// To avoid confusion, there is NO keyword called inherits like in C#.  You either
// extend an Abstract Class or you implement an Interface.  Both "inherit" stuff.
//
// This manager has FOUR properties. Managers will have a method called ScheduleMeeting. Employees will not.
// Interfaces define the Shape of the object....they enforce a Contract.
